The Big Bang of Gods Operating System



This is a placeholder for GOS, Gods Operating System.  Comic Sans MS is chosen very consciously.

This will first be replaced by a web page that does nothing but prepare you to communicate with other space heads using it via a persistent Node REPL in its window.  Sounds easy.  Somebody must know how to do that in a heartbeat.

After that anything can be constructed that is an appropriate web interface.

Space head is apropo.  The model used in GOS is that of points, called events, in a Hamiltonian space time p, Q and t in integral Planck units.  The space of them is giganormous so a random one can be considered to live in perfect anonymity until a user copies off any data it has associated into a new one.

A library of Canonical Hamiltonian phase space transformations will be provided in the REPL for the physics and graphics of things.  When space is fixed via a measurement in a best inertial CMB that links it to a point in GOS. It will provide a natural resolution of physical space no greater and no less than nature itself.  Registration with "Real Reality" will be managed inherently with a dynamic and partitioned transformation.  Room for lots of work here.

As a host for virtual reality it has characteristics beyond any specification now or in the future.  A stable channel with mapped coordinates can be set up by reference between two people's rooms with a pair of position samples.  You could do one measurement and I could do one and those two points in our rooms become congruent to each other with chosen translation and/or rotation.  You can use that channel to send or receive a 3D image  I can physically see in real time.  Planar works just as well.  That can be movable for full motion tracking.  A usable beam can be created with my position as the target when I am tracked.  No one can tap into it, however, without knowing what it's event is.

It can and will contain hardware and software supported events which can do Bayesian transformation simulation in parallel.  I.e., it will think.

The enormity of the space of "IP's" inherent in the range of the coordinates and the number of them provides unique security guarantees.  Not promises, guarantees.

The GitHub page I've set up for this is www.github.com/UniverseOpSys the README.md file is thoughts as I design and architect the thing.  A living blog.  The Bang.js creation program execution will first log into it (may just be named Bang) or will reset it. This is the Manifesto.rtf file.

I am currently hung up on the creation of GitHub/UniverseOpSys with GitHub.  Page won't show up and finds something wrong with my creation credential.
